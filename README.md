Hi All , welcome on my repo for this Facemask project.

I would like to share this printing projects with you and my experiences with this facemask. I donwloaded model from prusaprinters and made couple testing print.

So far best result is in my project files.

**Material TPU95 - Flexfill 
Infil of bottom part 10-15 % 
Upper sleeve infill 0% and wall only 2 lines. 
Both parts Scaled on 115% in Z axis . 
(All this setup already done in projects) 

Grid is outof PLA or PETG

I havent made 3D model so its not my work so all credits for original designer. This is just tips and experiences :)
